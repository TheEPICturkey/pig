* _JavaScript_

## Description

_On this webpage, a user will be prompted to input a number of their choosing. Upon entering a number, it will count up to their number by increments of one. Along the way, it will replace any number that includes the numbers 1, 2, or 3. Numbers including 1's will be replaced with 'beep', 2's will be replaced with 'boop', and 3's replaced with 'Won't you be my neighbor?'. The heirarchy here is 3, 2, then 1. So the number 13 for example would display as 'Won't you be my neighbor?', and won't show 'beep'. For the number 123, it will still only display 'Won't you be my neighbor?' in it's place as it takes precedence over the others._
